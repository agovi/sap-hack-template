# Automated SAP S/4 HANA Deployment
This repository contains templates which can be used for deployment of SAP S/4 HANA 1809 on SLES 12. The templates are configured to use custom images with pre-built SAP content. The images are refreshed periodically in an automated way to keep the SAP license valid.
